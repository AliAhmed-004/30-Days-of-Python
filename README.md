# 30 Days of Python Challenge
This is my approach to the 30 days of python challenge. From the GitHub repository https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python, I am starting my journey to learn Python in depth this time.

PS. I will only be doing the coding stuff.

## Day 1
It was pretty easy, since I already have the basics of Python down.

## Day 2
Quite a long exercise. Only issue I'm having is that most of the questions are almost the same, so it gets a little boring. Looking forward to more exciting exercises in the future.

## Day 3
WAYYYY too long!! The last part was a bit difficult since there was a need to recognize the pattern of the table, but I eventually got it.

## Day 4
