# 30 Days of Python Challenge
This is my approach to the 30 days of python challenge. From the GitHub repository https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python, I am starting my journey to learn Python in depth this time.

PS. I will only be doing the coding stuff.

## Day 1
It was pretty easy, since I already have the basics of Python down.

## Day 2
Quite a long exercise. Only issue I'm having is that most of the questions are almost the same, so it gets a little boring. Looking forward to more exciting exercises in the future.

## Day 3
WAYYYY too long!! The last part was a bit difficult since there was a need to recognize the pattern of the table, but I eventually got it.

## Day 4
Excellent day. Learned very useful String operations.

## Day 5
Very good exercises. Never knew we could do this much stuff with lists. Great tutorial!!

## Day 6
TUPLES!! Thought they were one of my worst nightmares, but its not that bad. Only thing confusing for me is the brackets used for lists, tuples and dictionaries. I always mix them up.

## Day 7
Fun and educational, this Python challenge on sets helps you understand the importance of unique elements and set operations. Great for learning practical data structure usage!
